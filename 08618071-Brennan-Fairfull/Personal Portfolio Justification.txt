The five items I have chosen to add are a mixture of my contributions to the planning activities and coding work I done 
during release one.

My first item is the Stories.xlsx which I contributed by coming up with several stories, adding acceptance criteria and descriptions
to many of the sorties. I also exported the stories from JIRA and added them to the google docs so they could be added the 
our git repository.

My second item is our release plan, I contributed to this by added descriptions to many of the release goals, adding story 
points and adding release 4.

My third item is models.py, I added several fields to our property model, including: bedrooms, property types, bathrooms, 
car_spaces. I ran migrations to update our database and added information to those new fields for each property. 

My forth item is property.html, I added to this by getting the template to read all the fields I added to our property model 
from the database.

My final item is test.py, I added to this by adding several tests to further test our property model from the database and added a selenium test to test our new search functionality.
